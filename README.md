> ## Description
<br />

Personal portfolio-cum-blogging website made using GatsbyJS for static page generator, Graphql, contentful for headless CMS, animations library AOS, and MaterialUI library. Static single-page application hosted on [vercel](https://krishna-d-k.vercel.app), and licensed under [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

> ## Inspiration
<br />

After a lot of development work, I suddenly got to realize that something was missing, which was my portfolio website. Even though I had some of my previous portfolios, they were mainly for practice. So here it is, my self made portfolio website, not for practice, but for real.
